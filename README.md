## Cyan101/Jos 👋
My resume is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFtTw4KSLTL-M5nFWiZO5dng_CpxUJJhpVGq74jYbo8/edit?usp=sharing) (PDF/Docx in my Profile Repo [here](https://github.com/Cyan101/Cyan101/)).

Favourite programmming language is Ruby.

Love RPGs, MMOs, Card, Story-Focused and Turn-Based Strategy Games.

Enjoy watching Anime, Detective, Sci-Fi and Comedy Shows.

My programming usually contains catgirls, but I do my best to keep them SFW as possible.
